## About
This repo actually ends up being a laptop config repo that installs most of the things that I actually care about having on a laptop, it installs homebrew and fish and everything else in the Brewfile from there and configures fish to operate and sets the defaiult shell to fish


## Setup

Run the `setup.sh` script and when it prompts, enter your password to set the default shell to fish.
